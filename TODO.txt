Repository with a score/rating system. Half the score is given by how
many packages use your packages, and the other half is given by user
rating/comments.


Prelude can still be manually imported and will cause two Preludes to
be imported. And the consequence is that symbols from Prelude will be
multiply defined.


LALR grammar rules really look like pattern matching... especially
those $1, $2, and so on...


Integration with software development tools, for example, online
repository, packages, and version control.


Add a synthesis declaration, for example,

sig f : a -> b -> a
def f x@ y@ = x

syn f : a -> b -> a


Expander should run before Reorderer because a definition that expands
can produce more than one definition.


Base types should be looked up in the environment instead of being
hardcoded in the parser. And base types should also be loaded in the
typechecker's context.


Unroll lambdas (anonymous functions) in 'Renamer'. There is an
undefined for lambdas in renamer.


Functions cannot be redefined in interactive.


Add type annotations like so?

  def f = x:Int (negInt x)

  def f = x:a (negInt x) -- polymorphic type


Remove '@' in empty list pattern.


Comments are broken.


Remove the benign shift/reduce conflicts.


Add lines in semantic errors.


Fix 'lt' the same way 'eq' was fixed. Find a solution for 'eq' for
user defined datatypes.


Fix mutually recursive functions.


Fix the pretty printer to print to 'String'.  Perhaps the pretty
printer and 'showAbbrev' can be combined in a single monad.


Add inductive and coinductive types :)


Infer types from predicates, i.e., eliminate the following casts

  def f x@isInt y@isInt = addInt (toInt x) (toInt y)


Typechecker crashes when functions are applied with the wrong number
of arguments.


Commands 'showRenamedM' and 'showModuleM' need refactoring.


Clean Core modules and the link stuff.


Rename 'flattenId' to 'joinId'.


Definitions and shadowing:
- redefinition of names is not being properly detected and reported
- check shadowing
- names in CondMacro (I believe) are being renamed twice
