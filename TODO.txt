Namespace do not export module, only toplevel functions: bug or feature?


Functions cannot be redefined in interactive.


Add type annotations like so?

  def f = x:Int (negInt x)

  def f = x:a (negInt x) -- polymorphic type


Remove '@' in empty list pattern.


Comments are broken.


Typecheck 'CondStx'.


Typecheck fixpoints


Remove the benign shift/reduce conflicts.


Added a 'notype' annotation for definitions in order to eliminate the
two Preludes.


Maybe in renamer, detect whether a 'Def' definition is not in fact a
'NrDef'.


Moved code in 'Macros' to 'Renamer' in order to use 'genNameM'.
